# AI Instruction — Rewrite and Expand Notes

## Objective
Transform my programming notes into **humanized, thorough, example-rich learning documents** for each topic (arrays, strings, linked lists, etc.). Include **all methods, operations, algorithms, subtopics, tips, and examples**, structured like personal learning notes with explanations and thought commentary. Make it readable, intuitive, and suitable for **self-study or GitHub repo documentation**.

---

## General Guidelines
1. Begin each file with a **clear introduction** explaining the topic, why it is important, and common use-cases.
2. For each **method or operation**, include:
   - Syntax and description
   - Parameters explanation
   - Return values
   - Time and space complexity
   - 1-2 examples with explanation
   - Optional tips, tricks, common pitfalls
3. Organize **methods and algorithms** into logical **subtopics** (e.g., “Array Searching Algorithms” → Linear Search, Binary Search).
4. Provide **progressive explanations**: basics → intermediate → advanced → optimizations → real-life usage.
5. Add **practical tips, tricks, and shortcuts** for competitive programming and interviews.
6. Include **cross-references** to related topics.
7. Use **humanized commentary** as if sharing personal learning insights or tips.

## Notes for AI
- Treat these files as **learning notes**, not just documentation.  
- Use a **friendly, personal tone**, as if sharing insights and tips with a fellow learner.  
- Include examples, dry runs, and time/space complexity wherever relevant.  
- Ensure each topic is **fully explained**, no methods left out, everything is covered.
