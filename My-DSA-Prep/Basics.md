# Programming Basics: The Foundation of Coding

Hey coder! Before diving into complex data structures, let's solidify the basics. This covers variables, data types, operators, and typecasting – the building blocks. Why important? Without these, you can't write a single line of code. Use cases: Every program starts here. In CP, understanding types prevents bugs. Let's make this intuitive with examples and tips.

## Introduction

Programming basics are the syntax and concepts every language shares. Variables store data, types define what data, operators manipulate, typecasting converts. Importance: Enables logic building. Use cases: Calculations, decisions, storage.

## Variables

Containers for data.
```python
x = 5
name = "Alice"
```
Rules: Start with letter/underscore, no keywords.

Example: Assign and print.
```python
age = 25
print(age)
```

## Data Types

### int
Whole numbers.
Range: Unlimited in Python.

Example: 42

### float
Decimals.
Precision: Double.

Example: 3.14

### str
Strings.
Immutable.

Example: "text"

### bool
True/False.

Example: True

## Operators

### Arithmetic
+, -, *, /, //, %, **

Example: 5 + 3 = 8

### Comparison
==, !=, <, >, <=, >=

Return bool.

Example: 5 > 3  # True

### Logical
and, or, not

Short-circuit.

Example: True and False  # False

### Assignment
=, +=, etc.

Example: x += 1

## Typecasting

Convert types.
int(), float(), str(), bool()

Example: int("123")  # 123

Pitfall: Invalid conversions raise errors.

## Examples

Calculate area.
```python
length = 5
width = 3
area = length * width
print(area)
```

## Common Mistakes

- Uninitialized variables.
- Type mismatches.

Tips: Use descriptive names, check types with type().
